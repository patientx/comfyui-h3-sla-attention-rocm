Drop it on the MODEL wire after the LoRA loaders, last before the sampler. It

not otherwise have -- and the reason that LoRA gives no speedup on its own.

    files contain only ordinary LoRA tensors, and the sparsity is decided at
    runtime from q and k. The LoRA's job is to make the model tolerate the
    sparsity, not to provide it.

    Measured end-to-end on a 5090 at 768p/15s with the SLA turbo LoRA:
    ~44 s/it dense against ~31 s/it at sparsity 0.85 and ~25 s/it at 0.90, so
    1.4-1.75x, with no extra VRAM. Attention is only ~30 s of that 44 s step,
    so the Amdahl ceiling is 3.17x however fast attention gets. See SLA.md for
    why the widely-quoted 2.5x is an eight-GPU number.
